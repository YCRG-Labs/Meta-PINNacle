\\subsection{Algorithm 1: MetaPINN Training}
The MetaPINN algorithm follows the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) framework adapted for physics-informed neural networks. The algorithm alternates between inner loop adaptation on individual tasks and outer loop meta-updates to learn optimal initialization parameters.

\\subsection{Algorithm 2: PhysicsInformedMetaLearner}  
The PhysicsInformedMetaLearner extends the basic MetaPINN with adaptive constraint weighting, physics regularization, and multi-scale handling. It dynamically balances different physics constraints based on their relative magnitudes and gradients during training.
